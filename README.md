# OpenAI_Gym_RL_Algorithms_Database

> About

- A database of various RL algorithms implemented in PyTorch for the OpenAI Gym Environments with code and explanations.
- All the algorithm implementation is from [sweetice's Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch repo](https://github.com/sweetice/Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch/tree/master).
- Each algorithm code is accompanied by a detailed analysis created for my personal learning.
- Refer to `RLAlgorithmsBreakdown.ipynb` for quick reference to each algorithm's architecture.
